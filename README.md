# Research
I am working with **Dr. Xiaojuan Li @ the Program of Advanced Musculoskeletal Imaging (Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute)** to use advanced MR imaging to promote musculoskeletal health. We are using generative models to predict osteoarthritis progression.

I am also studying the evaluation and fine-tuning of foundational generative models for small-domain tasks with **Dr. Vipin Chaudhary @ the Vipin Lab (Case Western Reserve University)**.

With **Dr. Sun Sunnie Chung @ Cleveland State University** I used real-time NBA basketball player movement data to predict plays. We also ran sentiment analysis of reddit comments during NBA games.
